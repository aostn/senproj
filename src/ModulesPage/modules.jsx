Trend Direction - The 200-day moving average is considered especially significant in stock trading. As long as the 50-day moving average of a stock price remains above the 200-day moving average, the stock is generally thought to be in a bullish trend. A Golden cross signifies the start of a bullish trend when the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average as shown in this picture. Once a Golden cross is formed, it gives confirmation to the trader that an uptrend is beginning and/or continuing."
