Owners of option contracts are not required to buy or sell the shares in the contract. Option contracts have due dates where the buyer must decide whether to exercise their option. Option contracts hold value that changes with higher volatility than stocks. The stated price on an option is the strike price. A buyer bets on whether a share price will go up or down by the expiration date.",

Trend Direction - The 200-day moving average is considered especially significant in stock trading. As long as the 50-day moving average of a stock price remains above the 200-day moving average, the stock is generally thought to be in a bullish trend. A Golden cross signifies the start of a bullish trend when the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average as shown in this picture. Once a Golden cross is formed, it gives confirmation to the trader that an uptrend is beginning and/or continuing."

            description: "Support is a price level where a downtrend can be expected to bounce due to a concentration of demand or buying interest. As the price of assets or securities drops, demand for the shares increases, thus forming the support line. Once an area of support has been identified, those price levels can serve as potential entry or exit points because as price reaches a point of support, it will do one of two things: bounce back away from the support, or violate the price level and continue in its direction until it hits the next support level. Support levels act as high probability areas where buyers want to buy the asset. For this reason purchasing an asset at this level is the best “bang for your buck.” Since everyone else wants to buy the asset in this area, there is a high probability the key level you identified will act as a bottom.",

Price in a market only moves because of two reasons - it is important to understand the auction process and how it works. If you have supply > demand, you may have a massive drop imbalance and there will be unfilled orders sitting at the origin location that did not get filled the first time since the price fell too quickly. In the above example, the price had a massive drop imbalance because supply (sellers) exceeded demand (buyers) thus leaving over unfilled sell orders in the origin location. This creates an overhead level of supply where looming sell orders exist. When the price revisits the same level where the origin imbalance was created, the unfilled sell orders begin getting filled. This makes supply zomes inherent resistance levels where price will struggle to get above - since supply exceeds demand. These levels are broader than a resistance line, however very similar. The only difference is that zones encompass a larger area. Imagine supply zones as large resistance areas with a huge concentration of sellers."

                    description: "The best way to find supply zones is to look at the candlestick chart. Here is the order of things to do to spot supply zones: Look at the chart and try to spot a massive drop imbalance. It is important that the price moves a lot. Establish the base (beginning) from which price started the quick move. Usually, before a large move, you have a small sideways move- that is where your supply zone is. The areas above show a basing period for the stock, then a steep move to the downside. These are the exact things we are looking for to identify supply. Price needs to be balanced for a period of time (consolidating), then have a massive drop imbalance which signifies that sell orders will be leftover in the origin location."

If you have demand > supply, you may have a massive rally imbalance and there will be unfilled orders at the origin location that did not get filled the first time since the price rose too fast. In this example, the price had a massive rally imbalance because demand (buyers) exceeded supply (sellers) leaving unfilled buy orders in the origin location. This creates a level of demand where looming buy orders exist. When the price revisits the same level where the origin imbalance was created, the unfilled buy orders begin getting filled. This makes demand zones inherent support levels where prices will likely bottom - since demand exceeded supply. These levels are broader than a support line, however very similar.
